Those are C++ functions, using the ArkScript virtual machine API to communicate with it. They can be used as any other function in ArkScript code.

## Basic template of a builtin

```cpp
#include <Ark/VM/VM.hpp>
#include <Ark/VM/Value.hpp>

Ark::Value myBuiltin(std::vector<Ark::Value>& parameters, Ark::VM* vm)
{
    return Ark::Nil;
}
```

Inside the VM, they are all prefixed by `builtin__`, and then remapped in their corresponding category in the standard library. Eg `builtin__list:sort` will have a definition inside `std/List.ark` as `(let sort (fun (_L) (builtin__list:sort _L)))`.

See [the tutorial on embedding](/docs/tutorials/embedding) for more details on how to use them.

## Builtins category

We currently have a few categories for our builtins:

- IO, prefixed by `io:` in ArkScript
- List, prefixed by `list:` in ArkScript
- Mathematics, prefixed by `math:` in ArkScript
- String, prefixed by `string:` in ArkScript
- System, prefixed by `sys:` in ArkScript
- Time, prefixed by nothing in ArkScript

## Adding a builtin

1. You need to identify the category it belongs to
2. Then add its prototype in `include/Ark/Builtins/Builtins.hpp` under the right namespace
3. Add it to the builtins list in `src/arkreactor/Builtins/Builtins.cpp`, as follows: `{ "builtin__<name>", Value(category::functionName) }`
4. The implementation will have to be done in `src/arkreactor/Builtins/{category}.cpp`
5. Add a proxy inside `lib/std/{category}.ark` as `(let <name> (fun (args...) (builtin__<name> args...)))`
5. Don't forget to document the new function **in the standard library**, using the following snippet:

```
# @brief Reverse a given list and return a new one
# @details The original list is not modified
# @param list the list to reverse
# =begin
# (list:reverse [1 2 3])  # [3 2 1]
# =end
# @author https://github.com/SuperFola
(let reverse (fun (_L) (builtin__list:reverse _L)))
```
